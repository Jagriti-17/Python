# You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plus sign before a number? What about 2++2?

# Solution:
# If we add a plus sign before a number does not change its value. In the expression 2++2, the two plus signs next to each other will be interpreted as a positive number followed by another positive number.
